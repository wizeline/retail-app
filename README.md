# retAIl – Hackathon README

## 1. Market and Customer Analysis

### 1.1 Target Segment
- Audience: Business-to-business (B2B) retailers
- Scale: Mid-market chains and enterprise-level operations
- Geographic Scope: International

Customer profile includes retailers with inefficient product placement, missed revenue opportunities, and limited analytical capabilities. Current practices are manual and reactive, with minimal integration of data science. Procurement typically follows enterprise contracting and SaaS subscription models.

### 1.2 Market Context
- Existing tools are manual or partially automated, lacking measurement of layout impact on margins.
- There is no clear link between product placement and profitability in current solutions.
- Market trends include increased digitalization, adoption of AI, and a growing focus on revenue optimization.
